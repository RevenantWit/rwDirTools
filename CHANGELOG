# v1.1.1 Update

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed -ExcludeDir parameters wildcard support.

# V1.1.0 Update

## Refactoring
- Eliminated code duplication: Moved Get-rwDirFromUI from public to private folder, removing inline implementation from Get-rwDirPath.ps1
- Modularized Out-rwMenuCLI: Split monolithic function into separate private helpers:
- New Show-rwSpectreMenu.ps1 – Spectre rendering only
- New Show-rwCLIMenu.ps1 – CLI menu rendering (Single, Multiple)
- Extracted Show-rwPromptYesNo.ps1 – Yes/No prompting logic
- Simplified parameter naming: Changed Mode to OutputMode for consistency
- Centralized automation: Added Get-rwDirToolsAutomation helper for environment variable checks
- Cleaner module loading: No longer uses wildcard to load the public functions
- Reduced verbose logging: Removed non-essential debug output
- Removed nested Get-rwDirFromUI definitions: One canonical version in Private folder

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed Read-rwNewDirName retry logic: Added missing continue statement for proper loop control
- Fixed Spectre error handling: Moved fallback logic from Show-rwSpectreMenu to Out-rwMenuCLI dispatcher for cleaner separation of concerns and better caller control
- Improved error feedback: Added explicit warning with exception details when Spectre rendering fails

## Tests
- Full automation mode support via environment variables

## Documentation
- Updated README with cleaner, more varied examples (not just script-based)
- Added menu usage examples with return types clearly stated

## Breaking Changes
- Changed: Out-rwMenuCLI parameter -Mode → -OutputMode

## Migration Notes
If upgrading from 1.0.0:
- Update parameter name -Mode to -OutputMode in Out-rwMenuCLI calls
